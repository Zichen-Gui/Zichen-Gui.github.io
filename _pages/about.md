Welcome to my personal website! I am an assistant professor at the University of Georgia (UGA). My research interests are applied cryptography, with a focus on encrypted databases and privacy-preserving computation.

Prior to joining UGA, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Applied Cryptography Group, ETH Zurich (April 2022-July 2024, hosted by [Prof. Kenny Paterson](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.paterson.html)). I received my MEng in 2017 and PhD in 2022 from the University of Bristol. I am grateful that I was advised by [Prof. Oliver Johnson](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~maotj/) and [Prof. Bogdan Warinschi](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Bogdan-Warinschi-65c61a03-5030-4d74-a164-c1b524269868/).
